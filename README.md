## Usage Rules

1. Please resolve video authorization issues on your own. All problems arising from unauthorized video usage must be borne by the user. This has nothing to do with Mov2mov!
2. All videos created with Mov2mov and published on video platforms must clearly cite the source video used for conversion in their description. For example, if you use someone else's video and convert it through AI, you must provide a clear link to the original video; if you use your own video, you must also state this in the description.
3. All copyright issues caused by input sources must be borne by the user. Note that many videos explicitly state that they cannot be reproduced or copied!
4. Please strictly comply with national laws and regulations to ensure content is legal and appropriate. All legal responsibilities caused by using this plugin must be borne by the user. This has nothing to do with Mov2mov!
